# CSE 620 Final Project

Final project for CSE 620 that performs modularity maximization on a graph of Stack Overflow tags using simulated annealing and other baseline algorithms specifically created for modularity maximization including the Louvain and Leiden algorithms.

The dataset is contained within the repository as a list of tags, stack_network_nodes.csv, and an adjancency list of tag links, stack_network_links.csv. 

The runnable files for the project include Louvain&Leiden.ipynb and simulated_annealing.py to run the respective algorithms.
